# University-Network
Design and Implementation plan for a University Network with 7 branches spread islandwide, to facilitate communication, resource sharing and other network facilities.

This project presentation outlines the design planing of the logical and physical network topology for the said network. Furthermore the presentation outlines the key aspects if identifying and selecting appropriate network devices, network technologies, and network protocols for a robust university network. In addition, an optmised and a detailed IP Addressing Scheme is derived using VLSM method, to interconnect devices and provide said network facilties.
