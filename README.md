# University Network Design Project ‚Äì XYZ University

This project presents the design of a secure, scalable, and high-performance network infrastructure for **XYZ University**, which operates across **7 branch campuses** and supports over **50,000 users**. The design considers logical and physical topology planning, device selection, media types, LAN and WAN technologies, and protocol integration based on the OSI model.

## üìå Key Deliverables

- **Logical and Physical Network Diagrams**
- **Core, Distribution, and Access Layer Design**
- **Device Selection** (e.g., Cisco Catalyst C9400, Juniper MX10004, TP-Link Omada)
- **IP Addressing Schema** using Class B private addressing (`172.18.0.0/16`)
- **Media Types**: CAT6, CAT7a, CAT8, and Fiber Optics
- **LAN Technologies**: VLANs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi 6
- **WAN Technologies**: MPLS, SD-WAN, Leased Lines, VPN
- **Security**: Juniper SRX4600 Firewall, Captive Portals, MAC/IP filtering
- **OSI Layer Protocol Mapping** for all 7 layers

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Cisco and Juniper Network Devices
- Ethernet Standards (CAT6/CAT7a/CAT8)
- Fiber Optic Backbone
- Wi-Fi 6 Access Points (TP-Link Omada)
- Protocols: OSPF, BGP, TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DHCP, ICMP, SIP, RTP

## üåê Project Scope

- Designed to serve over 50,000 users across 7 campuses
- Emphasized scalability, redundancy, and security
- Mapped all protocols and technologies according to OSI model layers
- Considered future expansion with cloud integration and SDN
