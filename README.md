# University-Network
Design and Implementation plan for a University Network with 7 branches spread islandwide, to facilitate communication, resource sharing and other network facilities.

This project presentation outlines the design planning of the logical and physical network topology for the said network. Furthermore, the presentation outlines the key aspects of identifying and selecting appropriate network devices, network technologies, and network protocols for a robust university network. In addition, an optimised and detailed IP Addressing Scheme is derived using the VLSM method, to interconnect devices and provide necessary network facilities.
